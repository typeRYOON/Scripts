# Pather : : A Quick Directory Changer
Path was designed to work on Windows machines, if there's an issue on UNIX machines, please contact me.

## Prerequisites
Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:
* Python 3.7+  
* Colorama installed **: : `pip install colorama`**

## Downloading the source code
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/typeRYOON/Scripts
cd Scripts
```
> Move the Pather folder to where you'd like for the internal program to subsist.  
> I suggest moving it to a folder without heightened permissions as Pather writes to its own internal files.

### Running setup.py
Run setup.py **: : `py setup.py`**  
> You will be prompted to enter where the Pather folder is ( folder with source code ).  
> Simply enter the current working directory.
